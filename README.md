### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Kirill Volkov, and I am a Scala and Java backend developer with over 5 years of experience. I am passionate about functional programming and bioinformatics and enjoy exploring the intersection between the two.

Technologies and Tools
Some of the technologies and tools that I use include:

`Scala`
`Cats`
`ZIO`

### Current Project

I am currently working on my pet project, [Rule Evaluator](https://github.com/Kirvolque/rule-evaluator), which is a Scala 3 library for evaluating boolean expressions using a custom syntax.

### Mentoring Experience
In addition to my development work, I also have experience mentoring and leading projects. I served as a tech lead and mentor for a group of students from Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University who were working on the [Variant Caller](https://github.com/Kirvolque/variant_caller) project. While I did not write the code for this project myself, I supervised the students and provided guidance and support as they implemented the project.
