### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Kirill Volkov, and I am a Scala and Java backend developer with over 5 years of experience. I am passionate about functional programming and bioinformatics and enjoy exploring the intersection between the two.

Technologies and Tools
Some of the technologies and tools that I use include:

`Scala`
`Cats`
`ZIO`

### Current Project

I am currently working on my pet project, [Rule Evaluator](https://github.com/Kirvolque/rule-evaluator), which is a Scala 3 library for evaluating boolean expressions using a custom syntax.

### Mentoring Experience
In addition to my development work, I also have experience mentoring and leading projects. I have supervised multiple student projects, including [Variant Caller](https://github.com/Kirvolque/variant_caller) and [Variant Annotator](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-internship-EPAM/variant-annotator), providing guidance and support as the students implemented their projects.

### Open Source Contributions
I have also contributed to open source projects, including the [HTSJDK](https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk) library developed by [The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). HTSJDK is a unified Java library for accessing common file formats, such as SAM and VCF, used for high-throughput sequencing data, with a number of useful utilities for manipulating HTS data. I have contributed to htsjdk by merging two pull requests:

- [PR #980](https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/980)
- [PR #979](https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/979)
